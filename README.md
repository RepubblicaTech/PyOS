# PyOS
A simple Python OS (Still developing)

## PyOS Tutorial

Here is a little video with a tutorial and an overview of the OS:

## Commands

### `help`

Displays available commands.

### `print`

Works like `echo` in Windows. Opens the Print Shell.

### `echo`

Just identical to Windows and Unix's `echo`. Now really.

### `about`

Displays the about box of PythonOS.

### `update`

Checks for pip packages' updates, doesn't update the OS.

### `ver`

Same as `about`, but more detailed.

### `clear`

Clears the shell input.

(I think that this command should had to be implemented as the first one...)
